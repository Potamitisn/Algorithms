# Algorithms

Algorithm implementations and exercise solutions based on the "Introduction to Algorithms" [book](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1614191). 

This is not a tutorial and does not try to optimize the algorithms in any way. 

It's just me implementing these algorithms in bare python and by doing so, understand the concepts better ðŸ˜Š
